# jdbann's dotfiles

Here they are, all my lovely little modifications. This repository is created to
extend [thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) to my own
personal preferences.

Simply pull both and follow the instructions to install via `rcup`.

## Manual steps

- Install the [One Dark][one-dark] iTerm theme
- Install the [iA Writer fonts]
